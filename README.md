# Latte Dock Thunderbird Extension

Adds unread count badge to Thunderbird running in [Latte
Dock](https://github.com/psifidotos/Latte-Dock) on KDE Plasma.

## Usage

Download the `lattedock-thunderbird-.0.0.3.xpi` extension in the `dist/`
directory. Install into Thunderbird.

## Build

To build use `ant` from the root directory.

To get `ant` you'll need to install it. On Ubuntu and Debian you can
find this via the `ant` package. On OS X it should be available in
